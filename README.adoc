= App CI/CD processes

== Deploying Jenkins Agent
`git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/containers-quickstarts.git`

```
oc process -f containers-quickstarts/.openshift/templates/jenkins-agent-generic-template.yml \
    -p NAME=jenkins-agent-npm \
    -p SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIR=jenkins-agents/jenkins-agent-npm \
    | oc apply -f -
```

== App build
```
oc process -f .openshift/app_build.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

== App deploy
```
oc process -f .openshift/app_deploy.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

== Jenkins
Set up a jenkins job to take in this Jenkinsfile. It will then take in any number of applications by setting parameters. The following params are required (with a suggested default):

PIPELINES_NAMESPACE = "app-ci-cd"
PROJECT_NAMESPACE = "app-${ENVIRONMENT}"
APP_NAME = "test-app"
SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF = "master"
ENVIRONMENT = choice(dev,stg,prod)

WILDCARD_ROUTE = "apps.ocp.example.com" (Though this could be hardcoded in local scm)

=== The pipeline
The following table will give an overview of each stage of the pipeline. The pipeline is based off the Jenkinsfile in this repo with the app being deployed from https://github.com/Tompage1994/sample-openshift-app[sample-openshift-app].

|===
|Stage Name
|Agent
|Tasks

|*Pre build*
|master
a| 1. Set environment variables
2. Set job configuration

|*App Build*
|jenkins-agent-npm
a| 1. Pulls the source repository from the specified branch
2. Downloads NPM packages and its dependencies specified in the source repository
3. Runs the build with the specified environment (eg: dev, staging, prod).
4. Stashes the `dist` directory to be used by other agents.

|*Prepare OpenShift Environment*
|master
a| 1. Build hostname variable based on app-name and environment.
2. Build the app_build manifest from template and apply it
3. Build the app_deploy manifest from template and apply it

|*App Bake*
|master
a| 1. Unstash the `dist` directory.
2. Patch the build config with the correct ImageStreamTag.
3. Build the latest image from the contents of current directory and stores the image in the Openshfit registry.

|*App Deploy*
|master
a| 1. Tag the newly built image to be used in the application namespace.
2. Sets the deployment config to use the newly built image.
3. Rolls out the latest deployment config
4. Verify the OCP deployment

|*Post build*
|master
a| 1. Prune old images
